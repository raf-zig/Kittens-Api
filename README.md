It is a project as part of [The Odin Project's Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-kittens-api). 
This is a fast and intuitive project that has the Rails application configured as an API for creating data... which is just a fancy way of saying that all controller methods will display data instead of HTML. Consider this an exercise in quickly creating a pure vanilla RESTful resource.
